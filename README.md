# Student Loans Prediction with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze and predict student loan outcomes. The application processes relevant loan data, applies machine learning models, and provides insights into loan repayment probabilities, default risks, or other financial metrics.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares student loan datasets for training.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses neural networks to analyze loan-related data.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Implements model training, validation, and performance evaluation.
- **Predictions & Insights**: Generates predictive insights on loan repayment trends.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```
## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb
```
2. Execute the notebook cells step by step.
3. Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different model configurations.

## Results & Insights
The model provides key metrics such as:

Loan repayment probability
Default risk classification
Feature importance analysis

## Future Enhancements
Implement hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
Integrate additional financial or demographic features.
Deploy the model as a web-based prediction tool.
